      <description>Well hello, you! I&amp;rsquo;m Matt,and this is the first post. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure how this will turn out, I tried to blog when I was in my early-twenties but that didn&amp;rsquo;t go very far and is now buried in the digital dust (thankfully). But I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired by Matt Dray&amp;rsquo;s recent Dear past self: blog ti start blogging, in particular his idea that his blog is his reference library.</description>
