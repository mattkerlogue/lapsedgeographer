        <p>Well hello, you! I&rsquo;m Matt,and this is the first post. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how this will turn out, I tried to blog when I was in my early-twenties but that didn&rsquo;t go very far and is now buried in the digital dust (thankfully). But I&rsquo;ve been inspired by Matt Dray&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/02/27/get-blogging/"><em>Dear past self: blog</em></a> ti start blogging, in particular his idea that his blog is his reference library.</p>

<p><em>I forget everything. Thatâ€™s especially true for code.</em> - Matt Dray <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to code, I concur. I sort of remember what I&rsquo;ve done and maybe what package I&rsquo;ve used, but I don&rsquo;t remember all the idiosyncrasies and pecularities of code. Despite making lots of graphs I still have to open the <code>{ggplot2}</code> <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html">functions reference</a> every single time I make a plot. So this blog is principally about letting me remember what I&rsquo;ve done and how I&rsquo;ve done it. Any additional benefit to others is a lucky coincidence, so you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<p>My academic background is in geography, it was the subject I loved most at school and went on to study at university, gaining a BSc in Geography from University College London. Afer university I worked for a small regeneration consultancy, mainly being an iterim policy researcher for the London Borough of Hackney. But after that I joined the Civil Service and until recently haven&rsquo;t been doing anything much geographical. I&rsquo;m still an analyst, and much of my foundational teaching in geography serves me well to this day. But I&rsquo;m certainly a lapsed geographer, and not up to date. Hence the blog name. Oh and I got a .london domain name because I&rsquo;m based in London.</p>
