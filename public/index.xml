      <description>Well hello, you! I&amp;rsquo;m Matt,and this is the first post. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure how this will turn out, I tried to blog when I was in my early-twenties but that didn&amp;rsquo;t go very far and is now buried in the digital dust (thankfully). But I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired by Matt Dray&amp;rsquo;s recent Dear past self: blog ti start blogging, in particular his idea that his blog is his reference library.</description>

      <description>Welcome Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Matt, and more than anything this blog is a reference library so that I remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve done/learnt. It&amp;rsquo;s also an attempt to motivate me to learn more, or rather learn in a more structured manner.
Posts will mainly be on data science tools and techniques, largely (but not solely) in R.
I work for the UK Civil Service, specifically in the Cabinet Office. This is a personal blog and anything published here is my own thoughts and views.</description>
