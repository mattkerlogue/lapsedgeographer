> *gongoozler* [n]  a person who enjoys watching boats and activities on canals  

I’m sure I’m not the first person, and won’t be the last, to remark that 2020 is a very strange year. October 2020 marks five years since I last went on a canal boat holiday. An anniversary that at the outset of this year I had hoped I might have managed to avoid by taking to the water sometime over the summer. So, inspired by Matt Dray's [recent adventures](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/09/21/londonmapbot/) in location-based Twitter-botting, I wondered whether it might be possible to make a Twitter bot that showcased features of the British canal network.
