Yeah, ok, it's late February, so a bit late for a "new year, new me"
declaration, but I've been feeling like I should write a little something
about... *\*waves hands in a generalised and unspecified fashion\**. So this
is a relatively short post about leaving the civil service last year, what I've
done since and what I'm thinking about for the future.

## Leaving the Civil Service

At the end of July 2022, after 15 and a half years I left the Civil Service.
There's a longer post that I probably ought to write[^1] about why I left and
some of the key lessons and reflections I have from my time in government[^2].

Long story short, and to mix metaphors, I felt I'd hit a brick wall and/or was
flogging a dead horse, but also that I'd run out of steam. I had previously
taken a career break in late 2015, which I extended to cover a stint working
for the OECD before coming back to the Civil Service in autumn 2017, but
ultimately I felt that a more concrete split was needed this time around[^3].

I was fortunate enough to be able to take the risk of resigning without having
another job lined up straight away. Honestly, I'd been considering leaving my
role for quite some time. When I returned from my first career break in 2017 it
was largely for a specific project[^4] and I hadn't actively committed to
returning for another long stint. In mid-2019 the InCiSE project had published
its second edition reports, other small projects continued to tide me over, as
well as helping the latest person to lead the People Survey team get to grips
with the project[^5]. ... *[Insert standard "and then in 2020 the world changed"
lines here.]* ... But yeah, then came Covid-19, and without going into details,
I felt exceptionally lost. My role changed focus in 2021, however I eventually
ended up feeling like I'd both hit a brick wall and was flogging a dead horse.

## Netflix and...
A mix of having no dependents, some savings, and changes in the running of
my family's business meant that I could afford to leave and spend a couple of
months without having a job to figure out what I'd do next[^6].

In the months between handing in my resignation and leaving, and afterwards, I
needed an answer to the question "what are you going to do next?", because
people don't like it you say "I don't know" or "nothing". As someone in their
late 30s I'm expected to have plans, I'm expected to know what I'm doing[^7]
and so the answer was "oh I'm going to take a couple of months 'off' and then
starting out as 'freelance data scientist' from September". That is the general
plan, as we'll come to see, but it's a slower timetable.

"September" soon became "October" and then "November", and by then there's no
point in doing something before the new year.

Despite all this time, I've not finished Netflix[^8], nor have I done a grand
tour of Europe or South East Asia.

## New year... new me?
So now we're definitely in the new year, the gas bills for December and
January were not pretty, and I also need some sort of structure/routine in my
days.

After a trip away for some winter sun at the start of February I'm finally
getting into the swing of things. I've put together a
[portfolio website](http://matt.kerlogue.co.uk)[^9], though arguably its missing
an item about the biggest project in my career history[^10]. I've just started
a freelance contract and have a couple of other things in the pipeline.

Finally, there's my various "side"/"open source" projects that I've started but
not done anything on for a while. In being 'busy' again, I'm starting to feel
like I'm motivated to put some effort into developing them again[^11].
And, I might (no promises) blog a bit more[^12][^13].


[^1]: Or series of posts most likely.
[^2]: I did provide some brief reflections at the Institute for Government's
[_Data Bites #33_](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/data-bites-33-getting-things-done-data-government) event in September 2022.
[^3]: I was also finding it increasingly difficult to feel able to work for a
government I did not believe in. Contrary to the sentiment expressed by Ron
Swanson in the GIF, I do continue to believe in government, and more
specifically in the principle of an impartial civil service that serves the
government of the day without fear or favour. But, personally I'd gotten to a
point where I no longer felt like I had the psychological strength to engage
with the balancing act that every civil servant goes through of balancing their
personal beliefs, views and ethics with the actions or positions taken by the
administration they work for.
[^4]: Leading the technical development of the [International Civil Service
Effectiveness (InCiSE) index](http://bsg.ox.ac.uk/incise), a collaboration
between the Blavatnik School of Government (University of Oxford), the
Institute for Government supported by the UK Civil Service and the Open Society
Foundations.
[^5]: My relationship with the Civil Service People Survey is definitely worth
a couple of posts a some point.
[^6]: I appreciate this is a great privilege, and it is a shame that large
employers/society doesn't see the benefit in providing a way for more people to
take a mid-career break in their 30s/40s.
[^7]: There's also probably some level of guilt in here, that I'm fortunate and
privileged to be able to afford (albeit briefly) to not work, especially at a
time of rising costs.
[^8]: Largely because I've just been rewatching different Star Trek franchises
on repeat. Yes, surprise, I'm definitely more of a _Trek_ than _Wars_ nerd...
that being said I watched _Andor_ and was thoroughly impressed with it, to the
extent I think it's one of the best TV series I've watched in a very long time.
[^9]: Probably should blog about how I put this together... though you probably
won't be surprised to learn it's also made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
[^10]: See footnote [5](#fn:5).
[^11]: I thought with having a load of free time with no commitments I'd devote
some of that time to doing something productive, like making my
[{tidyods}]({{< ref "2022-06-12-introducing-tidyods.md">}}) package sufficient
for posting a version to CRAN, or creating a
[successor to {deckhand}](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/deckhand2/issues/1).
[^12]: {{< figure src="/img/post/2023-02-21-sure-jan.gif" alt="Animated GIF of the Marcia Brady 'Sure Jan' meme">}}
[^13]: I did however create a [particularly niche card game](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/packageR-game/) that I do need to blog about.
