At some point I'll probably get round to putting `{tidyods}` and `{shrthnd}`
on CRAN, but in the meantime I've set up a repository on
[R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) that hosts these two packages.

<!--more-->

The main benefit is that R-universe provides binary packages, while both
packages use solely R code and there's no source compilation there are still
environments which might prefer binary version of the packages. And, as of
November last year, R-universe now
[builds WASM binaries](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/17/runiverse-wasm/)
for use with WebR. Not that I'm entirely sure whether there'd be a use case
for either of these with WebR, but it's a nice touch.

```r
install.packages("tidyods", repos = "https://mattkerlogue.r-universe.dev")
install.packages("shrthnd", repos = "https://mattkerlogue.r-universe.dev")
```

Also included in the R-universe repository are the `{govukhugo}` and
`{deckhand}` packages I created while working for the Cabinet Office.
